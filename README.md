# Homework 1
This assignment corresponds to chapter 2 (Names) and 3 (Functions) of the Clean Code textbook, applying concepts introduced in said chapters to an example code.

## New examples
I am working on a new set of examples as sticking to just a piece of old code is not enough to cover as much recommendations from the textbook as I would like to.

## Several set of files
I figured because the files got too big, I should put the different codes into separate files.
cc_clean_code corresponds to cc_bad_code
cc_clean_code_2a corresponds to cc_bad_code_2a
cc_clean_code_2b corresponds to cc_bad_code_2b
