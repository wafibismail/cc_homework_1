# Homework 1
This assignment corresponds to chapter 2 (Names) and 3 (Functions) of the Clean Code textbook, applying concepts introduced in said chapters to an example code.

## New examples
I am working on a new set of examples as sticking to just a piece of old code is not enough to cover as much recommendations from the textbook as I would like to.
